# Automator Plus Tutorials

Welcome to the Automator Plus tutorials GitHub repository. Here you'll find all code resources associated with the tutorial videos released on our YouTube channel.

Currently, we have tutorials for creating Adobe Premiere Pro automations on Windows using <a href='https://www.autohotkey.com/'>AutoHotkey</a> as well as using the <a href='https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources'>Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP)</a> API any either Windows or Mac and interact with and create extensions for Premiere Pro. Although the methods we discuss are applicable for any Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

Although AutoHotkey is a lot more intuitive and easier to get started with if you don't have a programming background, a method of being dependent on the OS has it's drawbacks. 

As with everything in life, whatever tools works for you and solves your problem, go ahead and use that tool. In other words, if it is easier for you to use AutoHotkey to automate a task, then go for it. However, there might be some actions you aren't able to do with AutoHotkey, or perhaps you want to build a plug-in that can work across multiple computers and operating systems. That is where CEP comes in.

 The <a href='https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources'>Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP)</a> allows us a way to program commands and actions directly into any Adobe Creative Cloud applications using a HTML5/JavaScript interface model. What this means is that with some HTML, CSS and JavaScript code you can interact with the Adobe applications and gain some super powers. 

 For Example:
